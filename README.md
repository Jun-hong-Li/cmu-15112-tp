Game Description:
Tower Defense, just like a normal tower defense game. There are two kinds of Monsters with diff speed and life-points, two kinds of Towers with diff functions. 
For Level 1-4 and self-edit level, the player wins if all the Monsters are gone/disappeared and the life-point of the final base is still larger than 0. Otherwise the player loses. 
For survival mode, as long as the player has not lost, the monsters would come out infinitely, with faster and faster speed. 
Pretty generic graphics and functionalities, but all the basic ideas are there, and it's pretty easy to upgrade due to the modularity of code. 


How to Run the game:
Open TowerDefense 1.0.py in the folder and run it. 

Modules used:
pygame.
Installation: Go to  http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.
For Windows users, download the installation file and run pygame.exe from the top level directory.
For Mac users, download the installation file, run it, and also go to https://www.python.org/ and download python for Mac, 32 bit. 
For Mac which has retina screen, also download an app called SetResX, and set the resolution of the screen to 1440x900 or 1280x800.

Hope you enjoy!
