\f0\fs24 \cf0 Game Description:\
Tower Defense, just like a normal tower defense game. There are two kinds of Monsters with diff speed and life-points, two kinds of Towers with diff functions. \
For Level 1-4 and self-edit level, the player wins if all the Monsters are gone/disappeared and the life-point of the final base is still larger than 0. Otherwise the player loses. \
